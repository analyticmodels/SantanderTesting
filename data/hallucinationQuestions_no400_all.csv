10132,How does your savings account earn interest compared to a high-yield money market fund on average days in March 2023?,Your high yield savings account earns interest by accruing daily and paying out monthly when your statement cycles.,"**Interest: Start date, payment date, variable rate** You'll start earning interest as soon as we receive your deposit. Interest accrues daily and is paid to your high yield savings account monthly when your statement cycles. Your statement cycle is based on the date when you opened your account, rather than on the first or last day of the month. The interest rates on Openbank's high yield savings accounts are variable, which means they may change up or down at any time without notice. This can happen when market conditions change or considering interest rate adjustments by the Federal Reserve. **Interest: Current rate, payment amount** To see your current interest rate, sign in on the Openbank app. In the middle of the Overview page, you'll find a card with your high yield savings account information. If you look just above your available balance, you'll see your current Annual Percentage Yield and interest paid year-to-date. There is no cap to the amount of interest paid. **About high yield savings account** High yield savings accounts are interest-bearing savings accounts that can offer higher interest rates than the national average of standard savings accounts. They're also FDIC-insured, if held at a member institution."
